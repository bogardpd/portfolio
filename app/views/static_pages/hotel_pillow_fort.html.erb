<h1>The Hotel Pillow Fort</h1>

<p>On one trip back in 2011, the hotel I had reserved was out of single occupancy rooms, and gave me a two-bedroom suite. I had three beds, sixteen pillows, and three sofa cushions, so I did what any reasonable person would do in that situation &ndash; build a pillow fort.</p>
