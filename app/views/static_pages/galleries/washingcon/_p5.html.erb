<p>The plan for the day was a trip into downtown Seattle.  We'd originally planned to leave at 9:30 AM, but we didn't end up actually heading out until a bit after 11.

<p>We finally managed to get going and worked our way down I-5 into the city. <abbr title="ShadowX">Brian</abbr> amazed us with his New Jersey driving skills, piloting his rental Forester through Seattle traffic in maneuvers a car its size shouldn't be able to accomplish.</p>

<p>Our first destination was Pike Place Market. We found parking in various garages for the five cars we took, and met up in Steinbrueck Park just outside the market so that we could split into groups.</p>

<p>The two groups then met back up at Pike Place Market.</p>

<%= link_header("1000 Blank White Cards", 3) %>

<p>Later that night, we played 1000 Blank White Cards.</p>

<p>For this game, players make a deck of custom cards using 3×5″ index cards. Each card has a title, an illustration, and a description. The description can be a point value, an action, or both.</p>

<p>Each player starts with seven cards, and play goes around in a circle.  On a player’s turn, the player draws a card from the deck, and then plays any card in their hand. The player may choose to play the card on themself (the action or point value applies to themself), any other player, or to the center (the action or point value applies to everybody). When a card is no longer in use, it is discarded.</p>

<p>The initial object of the game is to have the highest sum of point cards when the deck has been depleted. However, since the players can make up any card they choose, the rules of the game can constantly change.</p>
