<h1>Ingress Murals</h1>

<p>I play the geocaching game <%= link_to("Ingress", 'https://www.ingress.com/') %>. The game has some missions available which involve walking around to collect pieces of an image to form a mural. For some of these, Iâ€™ve plotted my location data on a map to show the route I walked to complete the missions.</p>
