<h1>Starmen.Net and Fangamer Conventions</h1>

<%= link_header "Starmen Cons", 2 %>

<p>Since the early 2000s, staff, moderators, and senior members of the <cite>EarthBound</cite> fansite <%= link_to "Starmen.Net", "http://starmen.net" %> have taken a group vacation together nearly every year. Generally, these involve splitting the costs of a large rental home among a few dozen people. I have attended a number of these conventions.</p>
