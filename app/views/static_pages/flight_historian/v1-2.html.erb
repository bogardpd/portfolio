<p>I’ve updated the Flight Log <%= link_to "Flight Log", "https://www.flighthistorian.com/", target: "_blank" %> to version 1.2 by adding codeshares, operators, and fleet numbers to flights.</p>

<p>Not all flights are operated by the airline that advertises it; often, airlines subcontract out flights to other airlines, particularly regional flights. In either case, whether the flight is operated by the advertising airline (i.e., <%= link_to "United", "https://www.flighthistorian.com/operators/UA", target: "_blank" %>) or a different operator (i.e., <%= link_to "ExpressJet", "https://www.flighthistorian.com/operators/EV", target: "_blank" %>), the Show Flight view now displays this. In addition, if the flight was a codeshare (where an airline sold a ticket on a partner’s flight), this is shown too.</p>

<!-- In this example, I bought a flight through American Airlines, but American Airlines didn’t offer a flight from Flagstaff to Phoenix, so they booked me a ticket on US Airways flight 2909 <%= link_to "", "https://www.flighthistorian.com/flights/309", target: "_blank" %>, and American sold it to me (as a codeshare) as American Airlines flight 2669. Then, since this was a short regional flight, US Airways didn’t operate it themselves; they subcontracted out to SkyWest Airlines <%= link_to "", "https://www.flighthistorian.com/operators/OO", target: "_blank" %> to actually operate the flight under the US Airways name. -->

<p>Clicking on the operator brings up details on a Show Operator view:</p>

<p>In some cases, I know the fleet number the operator uses for the aircraft, so the bottom of this page contains a list of the known fleet numbers.</p>

<!-- image -->

<p>Clicking on any fleet number will show details for all flights flown on that operator-fleet number combination.Finally, all of the operators are now listed on the Index Airlines <%= link_to "", "https://www.flighthistorian.com/airlines", target: "_blank" %> view, below the airline list:</p>

<p>…I fly on a lot of regional jets.</p>
